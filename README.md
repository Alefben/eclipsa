# eclipsa
Another discord bot project (uses discord.js) that does enormous things! (things that other bots also do...)

## About
Eclipsa is a Discord bot project for my server. I'm making this bot because I really want to improve myself on JavaScript, I had some other bot projects but I didn't even know what I was coding while making them! Now I'm making this again to have fun while learning!

## Features
* Does not use other modules like `commando`, it's plain discord.js.
* Fully modular & customizable
* Easy to understand

## Usage
* Clone this repo.
* Fill the `storage.json` as your liking.
* Run `npm i` in the main directory
* You're done!
